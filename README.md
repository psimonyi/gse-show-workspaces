# Show Workspaces

This is an extension for GNOME Shell 3.26+ that expands the Workspace switcher
in the Overview when workspaces are in use, as in previous versions of GNOME
Shell.

When this extension is enabled, the workspace switcher will be expanded when
you have set a fixed number of workspaces, or are using more than one of the
dynamic workspaces.
